Executors class provide simple implementation of ExecutorService using ThreadPoolExecutor

we are creating a fixed-size thread pool of 5 worker threads.
 Then we are submitting 10 jobs to this pool.
 Since the pool size is 5, it will start working on 5 jobs and other jobs will be in wait state,

 As soon as one of the job is finished, another job from the wait queue will be picked up by worker thread and getâ€™s executed.
