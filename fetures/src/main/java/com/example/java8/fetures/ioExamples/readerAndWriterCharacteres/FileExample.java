/*

The Java IO File class is Javaâ€™s description of a file or pathname of a directory.
 Since file and directory names have distinctive arrangements on various platforms,
  a naive string is not sufficient to describe them.
  The File class comprises various approaches for operating with the pathname, removing and renaming files,
generating new directories, arranging the contents of a list, and managing numerous general properties of files and directories.

Instances of the File class are immutable. That is, once created, the abstract pathname denoted by a File object will nevermore change
