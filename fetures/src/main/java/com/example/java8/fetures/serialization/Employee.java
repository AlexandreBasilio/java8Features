/*
Notice that itâ€™s a simple java bean with some properties and getter-setter methods.
 If you want an object property TO BE NOT SERIALIZED o be not serialized to stream, you can use TRANSIENT keyword like I have done with salary variable.

 Now suppose we want to write our objects to file and then deserialize it from the same file.
  So we need utility methods that will use:
    ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream for serialization purposes.

  serialVersionUID:
. Java uses class variables, methods, class name, package etc to generate this unique long number.
